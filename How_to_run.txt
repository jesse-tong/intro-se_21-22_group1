Install MariaDB, create an account that can create, read/write on a database.
Also install latest version of Node.js and Python as well.

In the .env file in the backend directory, there will be a line like this
SQL_URL="mariadb+pymysql://username:password@database_url:3306/library"
Change it to the corresponding in your MariaDB setup
You can also change other variables in the .env file as well, there's another .env file in the project root path for reference (path from backend directory)

Then create a Python virtual environment, install required packages: 
python -m venv .venv
. .\.venv\Scripts\activate (for Windows) or . ./.venv/bin/activate (for Linux and MacOS)

Install Node.js packages, in the project directory: npm install
Build the project frontend: npm run Build
Run the project: npm run server_windows (Windows) or npm run server_unix

We planned to create a Dockerfile, but we didn't have enough time for that
